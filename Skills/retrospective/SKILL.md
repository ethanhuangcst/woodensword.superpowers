  Post-task retrospective — persist lessons into specs/adr (decisions) and specs/knowledge (reusable
  research/ops/domain notes). Use when a feature or story is done, after DoD, after a hard bug or
  architecture choice, when the user says retrospective / lessons learned / 回顾 / 总结经验, or invokes
  /retrospective. Required gate in the dod rule before marking work complete.

# Retrospective Skill

After completing a task or feature, extract lessons learned and persist them in the project repository as:

1. **ADRs** (`specs/adr/`) — durable architecture / process **decisions**
2. **Knowledge** (`specs/knowledge/`) — reusable research conclusions, ops lessons, and domain notes that are **not** themselves a decision record

Create `specs/knowledge/` (and `specs/adr/`) if missing. Do not invent a parallel knowledge tree.

## When to Use

- After completing a feature (post-DoD)
- After resolving a difficult bug
- After making a significant architectural or process decision
- After research that produced durable domain or ops insight
- When the user explicitly requests a retrospective

## Process

### Step 1: Review What Happened

Look back at the completed work and identify:

**What went well?**
- Approaches that worked better than expected
- Decisions that proved correct
- Tools or patterns that were effective

**What was difficult?**
- Blockers encountered and how they were resolved
- Approaches that failed before finding the right one
- Unexpected complexity or edge cases

**What would you do differently?**
- Better approaches discovered in hindsight
- Things to avoid next time
- Process improvements

**What new knowledge was learned?**
- Domain facts, API/ops quirks, research conclusions
- Reusable runbooks, glossaries, data-source maps
- Constraints or gotchas that future work should reuse

### Step 2: Split Insights — ADR vs Knowledge

| Persist as | When | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ADR** | A choice was made among alternatives; non-obvious; durable; team-relevant | `specs/adr/` |
| **Knowledge** | New reusable understanding (research, ops, domain, how-to) that is not primarily a decision record | `specs/knowledge/` |

**ADR-worthy** — all of:
- **A decision** — a choice was made between alternatives
- **Non-obvious** — not derivable from reading the code or specs alone
- **Durable** — likely still relevant later
- **Team-relevant** — useful for anyone on this project

**Knowledge-worthy** — any of:
- Research conclusions or evidence summaries worth reusing
- Operational lessons (ingest paths, API quirks, env setup gotchas)
- Glossaries, matrices, data-source maps, enrichment notes
- Design-direction notes that inform work but are not a formal ADR

Skip both when:
- Ephemeral task details only
- Already documented accurately in code or product specs
- Obvious best practices with no project-specific twist

One retrospective may produce **zero or more** ADRs and **zero or more** knowledge docs. Prefer quality over quantity.

### Step 3: Determine ADR Number

```bash
ls specs/adr/
```

If `specs/adr/` does not exist, create it first.

Next number = highest existing `ADR-{NNN}-*.md` + 1 (zero-pad to 3 digits). If none exist, start at `001`.

### Step 4: Write ADRs (if any)

Create `specs/adr/ADR-{NNN}-{short-title}.md`:

```markdown
# ADR-{NNN}: {Title}

## Status
Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded (by ADR-XXX)

## Context
[What situation or problem led to this decision?]

## Decision
[What was decided? Be specific.]

## Rationale
[Why this over alternatives? What alternatives were considered?]

## Consequences
[Results, trade-offs, risks, follow-up actions.]

## Date
{YYYY-MM-DD}
```

Use Chinese or English consistently with the rest of the project's documentation (same language within a single ADR).

### Step 5: Write Knowledge (if any)

#### 5.1 Ensure knowledge home exists

```bash
mkdir -p specs/knowledge
```

If `specs/knowledge/README.md` is missing, create an index:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base

Reusable research conclusions, ops lessons, and domain notes (not code truth).
Product requirements live under `specs/`. Architecture decisions live under `specs/adr/`.

## Index

| Doc | Topic | Updated |
|-----|--------|---------|
```

#### 5.2 Choose topic folder + filename

- Group by topic area: `specs/knowledge/{topic-area}/{doc-slug}.md`
- Use project-relevant folders only (e.g. `openai/`, `maps/`, `zodiac/`, `testing/`)
- Reuse an existing topic folder when the subject already belongs there

#### 5.3 Knowledge doc template

```markdown
---
title: {Short title}
type: research-note | ops-lesson | domain-note | design-direction
status: active | draft | superseded
as_of: {YYYY-MM-DD}
tags:
  - {tag}
related_spec: specs/{relevant-spec}.md
related:
  - knowledge/{topic}/{other-doc}.md
  - adr/ADR-{NNN}-{short-title}.md
---

# {Title}

## Summary
[One short paragraph: what was learned and why it matters.]

## Evidence
- Sourced facts / user-provided context / what was tried

## Lesson / guidance
[Reusable takeaway for future work.]

## Links
- Related ADRs, specs, or knowledge docs
```

Rules:
- Knowledge is **not code truth** — product AC stays in requirements/design specs; decisions that bind the architecture go in ADRs
- Link ADRs from knowledge (and vice versa) when a lesson led to a decision
- Update `specs/knowledge/README.md` Index when adding or renaming docs
- Prefer amending an existing knowledge doc when the topic already exists; do not duplicate

### Step 6: Commit (only when the user requests)

Present created/updated paths first. Commit **only** if the user asked for a commit or project workflow requires it:

```bash
git add specs/adr/ specs/knowledge/
git commit -m "docs: retrospective — ADR and knowledge updates"
```

Stage only paths that changed.

## Output Format

```
## Retrospective Summary

**Completed:** [feature/task name]

**ADRs created:**
- specs/adr/ADR-001-….md — [one-line why]

**Knowledge added/updated:**
- specs/knowledge/{topic}/{doc}.md — [one-line what was learned]

**Skipped (not worth persisting):**
- [anything considered but not saved]
```

If nothing is ADR- or knowledge-worthy, say so clearly — an empty retrospective is valid.

## Important Notes

- Quality over quantity — 1 good ADR or knowledge note beats 5 mediocre ones
- ADRs are immutable records — never edit a past decision; create a new ADR that supersedes it
- Knowledge docs may be updated in place when facts change; bump `as_of` and note what changed
- ADRs live in `specs/adr/`; knowledge lives in `specs/knowledge/` — both are committed team assets
- Use Chinese or English consistently with the rest of the project's documentation
